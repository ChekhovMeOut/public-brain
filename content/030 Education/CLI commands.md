```powershell
# Navigation
	# change directory
		# argument "\" goes to top level directory
		# argument " .." or ".." to move upward to parent directory 
		# argument "folder1/subfolder1" to move through multiple directories

	ren name1.txt name2.txt 



```

### <span style="color:#00b080">GitBash</span>
- You have to say git before every command? I guess
- Directories are supposed to be forward slash ```cd /c/users/wiatr/PycharmProjects/```
```bash
# All
	# Dir command analog
	pwd
	# Kind of like Dir. Tells you what commit and branch status is.
	git status
	# Add filename.extension to commit. use --all to add everything in directory
	git add myfirstscript.py
	git add --all
	# Seals anything added to a commitment with the explanitory comment
	git commit -am "Version 1.2 with updated data structure"
	# Sends the commit to Github.com and publishes it
	git push
	#
```
